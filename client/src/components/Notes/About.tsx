            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>
              Starting in 2014 out of our family workshop in Como, Italy; we
              have teamed up with 8 fellow Italian artigiani or craftsmen, all
              very eager to showcase their artisanal heritage and quintessential
              designs. (read more on Our Artisans)
            </p>
            <p>
              From hand-hemmed tips to hand-stitched shoulders, our artisans
              craft all 40 Colori garments and accessories according to the
              highest quality standards to create hard-wearing everyday pieces
              for a timeless casual elegance.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make this happen, we provide them with the canvas to turn into
              their next creation. We travel around Italy, visiting mills and
              merchants to find the best fabrics and yarns, making sure they are
              natural, colourful and responsibly sourced. (read more on Our
              Materials)

            <h3>How We Work</h3>
            <p>
              We opted for a direct-to-artisan distribution model focused on
              made-to-order and custom services to ensure that we produce as
              much as possible what is needed exactly as needed by the final
              customer, with less compromises and wasteful use of resources. All
              with honest pricing, because more meaningful buying should not be
              a luxury. (read more on Our Approach and Ethical Quality)

              Shop now our core collection of timeless designs that we truly
              love. Our core collection is rarely available immediately and
